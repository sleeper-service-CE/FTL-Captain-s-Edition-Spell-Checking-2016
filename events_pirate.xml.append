	<text>A small blip appears on the system map. The sector archive lists this ship as a local pirate with a long rap sheet. "Unidentified cruiser, surrender or you will be destroyed." They are closing in fast.</text>
	<text>A small ship remains stationary in the distance. Its captain hails and claims that she is a Federation requisition officer, here to collect the war toll from passing ships. When you demand to see the official requisition license, the ship's weapons come live. "You resist a Federation official? We will take what we demand by force then."</text>
	<text>The captain of this ship with pirate markings claims to be an official Rebel requisition officer. When you refuse to donate to the Rebellion, the ship cuts coms and moves in to attack.</text>

	<text>The constant maneuvering almost throws you out of your seat. Steady now!</text>
	<text>All of the sudden the opponent turns and boost into your direction, you barely manage to avoid a collision. This definitely caught you off guard. The maneuver was either very well planned or completely mad.</text>
	<text>While your weapons trace the enemy, the ship briefly passes in front of the systems sun. For a split-second, it appears as a majestically illuminated shadow in front of the giant star. A brief image of beauty during the cruel carnage of ship-to-ship combat.</text>
	<text>"Enemy structural integrity is failing, Captain. We got this!"</text>
	<text>"Shots continue to connect, Captain. Good effect on target."</text>

	<text>Your opponent hails, but the transmission is completely garbled.</text>
	<text>Your opponent hails, but the transmission is interrupted by the hits the enemy sustains. You decide to pay this no mind and focus on keeping a lock on the enemy.</text>
	<text>Suddenly electricity arcs out of your console. "Isolate this coupler and reroute my command to another station."</text>
	<text>As your ships exchange fire, your opponent starts to send one insulting hail after another. You decide to ignore this and focus on the combat at hand.</text>
	<text>You remember this maneuver from the academy! Did you opponent at some point receive training from the Federation?</text>
	<text>You never saw the maneuvers your opponent is flying, but they are not without style. The enemy Captain must have been trained in some remote alien flight school.</text>
	<text>The enemy craft seemed to have had some additional passengers aboard. Escape pods are jettisoned from the craft and tumble far away into open space. The enemy starts to abandon ship.</text>
	<text>The dampeners run on full as you maneuver and exchange fire with your enemy. The heat aboard the ship becomes almost unbearable.</text>
	<text>You stand in front of the captains chair, focused on the windscreen, bellowing orders to your crew. You will not let this opponent get the better of you!</text>
	<text>Just after you bellowed this last order, everything becomes still for a second. You see yourself from the outside, clutched to one of the silver railings that lines the ship bridge, shouting orders, gesticulating at the screen... Then you remember your parents, your childhood, your time at the academy, the line of cause and effect that brought you here; to another fight to the death. What has become of you?</text>
	<text>Hold it steady and stay on target... Just like in the simulations.</text>
	<text>You will defeat this enemy, just like the ones you defeated before. For the Federation! You father would be proud.</text>
	<text>You are determined to not let this opponent get the upper hand. "Fire when ready!"</text>
	<text>The combat noticeably strains the ship. Sparks fly from sealing panels and acrid smoke covers the floor. You smell burned plastic and you own sweat.</text>
	<text>For a moment you are afraid of loosing it. What if we don't make it? What if we can't escape or defeat the next enemy? You don't want to die! Then it passes... The crew does not seem to have noticed, or at last isn't showing it. You take a deep breath and recollect yourself, then you ask for a situation report and try to focus on the battle.</text>
	<text>The ships hull creak under the stress of the combat maneuvers. You hope the ship can take it.</text>
	<text>Your fire tears away a huge section of the enemy plating. Good hit!</text>
	<text>Hull plating is scattered into space as your shots impact on the enemy craft. You'll pick those up later.</text>
	<text>Your opponent's hull is covered with glowing impact craters of various sizes. They won't be able to take this kind of punishment much longer.</text>
	<text>You are hailed: "Hey, Captain, should we call it a draw? Ha, just kidding! Bring it on!"</text>

<textList name="BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS">
	<text>You overhear a conversation on the neighboring table "So... you lost your interceptor?" "Been drifting for two standard weeks in the escape pod" "What happened?" "Maul beam hit to the cockpit. Almost took my arms off." "Tough luck." "Tactics, they knew our maneuverability was our strongest advantage."</text>
	<text>The canteen is pretty empty, but their Sidewinder Fang beer isn't that bad.</text>
	<text>A refugee buys you a second drink. She escaped from a nearby pirate sector and is glad to have found a better life here. Pirates burned down her crops and her whole family was starving for months. Food rations must be in high demand there.</text>
	<text>As you get your stuff you notice the bartender's tentacles are shaking. "Sorry, Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as many pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness, but we never had enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
	<text>As you get your stuff you notice the bartender's tentacles are shaking. "Sorry, Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as many pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness, but it was never enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
	<text>You are having a double Nebula Rake cocktail. Some union traders talk about the profit they made with exporting beacon parts to the expanding Mantis swarms.</text>
	<text>You are having a Slime cocktail. A young Slug compliments on your choice of beverage and you have a little chat. He claims that he is employed in ship construction in the home nebula. Work is slow, they never can get enough raw ore for hulls.</text>
	<text>The bartender is happy to meet a Federation person. She tells you her story... After slaving away in a coreworld factory she later made a fortune by exporting luxury goods to the Slug nebula and bought this old station to settle down for good.</text>
	<text>As you sip on your alcohol infused pure water, you overhear a conversation at the bar, "Everything was fried, Cap. We ordered replacement electronics weeks ago, but the carrier did not arrive." "So you abandon the whole station?" "Life support was failing. Without spare electronics, stations are doomed in nebula."</text>
	<text>You are having a Zoltan Peace Cocktail; it calms your nerves. A leaflet on the table explains that the trade union is looking for carriers to deliver beacon parts to uncharted nebulae. Their expansion plans are still pushed forward, even with the civil war going on.</text>
	<text>The station has a good micro brewery, you take the Solar lager. Most unusually, a Rock sits on the bar, emptying bottles of hard spirits. He addresses you, "Hey you! Sell me industrial machines!" You are slightly startled and explain that you don't have any. The Rock nods. You can't tell if he is drunk or just not sociable at all.</text>
	<text>You smoke a hydrogen cooled water-pipe, sun-storm flavor, and then check the blackboard. Several refuges from near civilian sectors offer good money for shield components. Everyone wants to protect themselves better these days.</text>
	<text>Some pirates brag loudly about their latest coup, "... and what do we find in the crates? Stone-plates, actual Rock literature!" "No way!" "What a letdown." "Better luck next time." "You don't get it do you? I told you I know these history guys in Zoltan space. They're gonna pay a fortune, you'll see!" "Yeah, sure..."</text>
	<text>You get a creme bowl and study the propaganda leaflets the Rebels have distributed here. They call on all freedom loving people to support their campaign by joining their forces or at last by donating engine components to their fleet.</text>
	<text>You are having a hydrogen-iced fruit cocktail. A Zoltan preacher is on space TV. He offers salvation for all peace loving people and explains in length the Zoltan initiative to pacify the galaxy by buying ship weapon components and small arms at subsidized prices.</text>
	<text>The bartender seems to be intoxicated by some substance. He explains they used these hallucinogens all the time on his old pirate hideout, but now he is almost clean. "Some Slug trader came each cycle. The stuff costs a fortune, but we would pay anything, Cap. Good times... until this Fed cruiser blew the place up."</text>
	<text>The place looks much less rough inside than on the outside. Modern art-pieces are arranged in the canteen. The Zoltan bartender notices your interest in her collection. "I got bored by the homeworlds, so I came here and show these works to common people. Back home this is worth a fortune, but I feel only here do beings truly appreciate it."</text>
	<text>Some union traders hang out at the bar. "Sister, trading with these things is so tedious. I got me this new translator, but I still don't get what they want most of the time." "Tell me about it. You want to hear what problems I got on my end? Do you even know how difficult is to get this stuff out of Mantis territory?"</text>
	<text>Some drunken cowboy-type ship Captain tells you the story you did not ask to hear, "It's not the same like in the old colony days... Trading live animals, you know, a hangar full of cattle? Now it's only tube bred livestock from the Slug nebula. And I sell it to these robots, don't wanna know what they do with it..."</text>
	<text>While you sip your import brew you browse through an old Federation fleet manual, lying beer-soaked on the bar. You remember the lesson on interceptor defense quite well from the academy. The chapter explains in detail the advantage of burst firing missile weapons against this ship type.</text>
	<text>While you wait for your ration-smoothie, a union trader tries to coax you into buying his load of compressed nebula gas. "Okay, okay, who am I trying to fool here. We both know this stuff is worth almost nothing. I guess I have to journey to Rock territory again then..."</text>
	<text>A intoxicated stock operator buys you a second drink. Then a third one. He talks in length about the "hyper tons of money" he makes each day in the nearby industrial sector, speculating on the prices for ore and gas. You get quite drowsy and hurry to get out of here.</text>

	<text>"FTL reaction is looking good, Sir. Reactor performance at maximum." You spend the majority of the journey with filing captains logs.</text>

	<text>The dedicated hyperspace scanner soon loses track of the Rebel fleet. Looks like you have outrun them for now.</text>

	<text>The fleet's collective FTL signature becomes a slim line on the hyperspace horizon; soon the rear scanners lose the Rebel ships entirely. You manage to get a lot of space between you and the Rebels, but the ship's hull sustains some damage in the process.</text>

The ship takes some damage during the emergency maneuver.</text>
	<text>The entire ship shudders when reaching its top speed. You request constant reports from the engines room. Soon, the ship systems can't take it no more. "Secondary containment is failing, Captain. We completely rely on primary now." Just a little longer. You are almost there...</text>
	<text>Your ship explodes towards the next sector, causing the hyperspace equivalent of a tidal wave in its wake. Soon you have to slow down again, a big portion of your front hull is already gone. Hyperspace scans no longer show any traces of the Rebel fleet though. You've lost them for now.</text>
	<text>Additional fuel is readied and your crew requests confirmation of the order. "Ignite!" The visual representation of hyperspace on your screen changes within a split-second.

	<text>The Engi is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crewman has shut its body down in its personal quarters to calculate something.</text>
	<text>Your Engi crew member expresses that the situation is grim, but not hopeless.</text>
	<text>Your Engi crew member expresses "Level 5 gratitude" for being allowed to serve under your command.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member expresses "adequate doubts" concerning the chances of its survival on this mission.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member says your command and leadership style is "sufficient" and goes back to work.</text>
	<text>The Engi asks if you require anything specific from it. You do not, and the being immediately walks away.</text>
	<text>The Engi runs some personal simulations, but still can't make reliable predictions on the outcomes of your mission. "Random factors: substantial. Additional: Outcome dependency on your actions almost 100 percent."</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member tries to explain to what extent it is able to have individual feelings. You don't really get it.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member is very concerned about their home sectors. "Information on current situation available: yes/no?"</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member discusses some details with you on the current state of the shield system.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member says it is still "processing" an engagement with the Mantis it had before joining your crew.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member wants to discuss how to improve the ship's engines. It stresses the importance of mobility.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member claims it once survived being shot at with a scrap-firing flak gun. If you didn't know better, you'd say the robotic crewman is actually proud of the feat.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member stresses the importance of good medical facilities aboard the ship.</text>

	<text>The Engi crew member tries to explain the neural-field tech on which mind control devices are based on.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member reveals interesting details about the advanced hacking systems its species is working on. The Engi where quick to adopt to this new technology.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member claims that its mind was once "hacked" by a hostile invader craft. The being lost control of its body and was forced to attack other crew members. You believe this must have been done by one of these new mind control systems available everywhere in the galaxy now.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member suggest the ship's door system should be carefully maintained. It seems to worry about hostile boarding parties.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member claims that it alone has witnessed over a hundred of its kind being killed by Mantis invaders during its long life. "Concept of 'hate' unavailable to Engi. Introduction to hive emotion matrix [only partial translation possible] necessary, in order to apply to Mantis species only."</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member claims that it feels by your standard "indifferent" towards the  Mantis as well as the Rebels. "Logic alone suggest peaceful coexistence as most favorable strategy for post FTL civilizations. Mantis and Rebel logic: flawed."</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member has some kind of mechanical disease. "[translation failure] present. Infection risk for your species: 2.45 percent. Caution advised."</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member claims that it alone has witnessed over a hundred of its kind die to Mantis invaders during its long life. "Concept of 'hate' unavailable to Engi. Introduction to hive emotion matrix necessary, in order to apply for Mantis species only."</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member suggests equipping the ship with several advanced drones. It is claiming that these would be more efficient than most conventional weapons.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member stresses the importance of a good defense against missiles in battle. It explains that its people have developed advanced drones that can even intercept entire swarms of missiles.</text>
	<text>The Engi crew member forms a part of its arm into a metallic flower and presents it to you. "Sign of appreciation adequate?" You politely thank the being for the strange present, made from its own body. Will the Engi want to have that thing back at some point?</text>
	<text>Your Engi crew member has a lot to say, but you forgot your universal translator on the bridge. You just understand numbers, gibberish and something that sounds like radio static.</text>

	<text>Your Mantis crew member looks quite pleased with itself. When you ask why, it explains how it just figured out what a fortune it can make from selling Rebel POWs as slaves. You're not sure if you are happy that this crewmen is on your side.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis crew member speaks openly, but you forgot your universal translator on the bridge. You just hear a wide variation of soft clicking.</text>

	<text>Your Mantis is busy sharpening claws. "Later, Captain." You rather prefer not to bother the creature...</text>
	<text>Your Mantis wonders when will be the next time it gets to kill a fully sentient being. It seems to be worryingly eager to do so.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis explains it is, "to put it in your language, a vicious killing machine." It wonders what else you could ever want to know about it.</text>
	<text>The Mantis is coughing up some acid as you approach it. "Better stand back, Captain. Caught a Mantis cold. Hehe." You are not sure if the creature is indeed sick or just wants to scare you.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis crew member explains at length the joy of feasting on raw meat.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis crew member describes in detail the taste of human blood. "Ah sorry Captain, I thought this might interest you... Did you ever think about this? That Rebels taste just like Federation humans? Maybe you and the enemy are not so different after all." You'd rather not contemplate on that.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis asks if you ever thought about how it would be if everyone in the galaxy hated you, even members of your own species. "A rhetorical question, of course. I learned this speech structure recently and I'm certainly fine with the challenging life I've chosen. Even a little proud."</text>
	<text>Your Mantis explains that, even after serving for some time under your command, it still does not understand the concepts of empathy and compassion.</text>
	<text>Upon your inquiry, the Mantis freely explains how the acid it spits is produced in its throat. Fascinating and scary.</text>
	<text>The Mantis claims it has killed several dozens of humans before joining the Federation. It wants to know how this makes you feel.</text>
	<text>The Mantis says it likes the Rock, because they are strong opponents.</text>
	<text>The Mantis wonders, "Will the humans ever prove to be more than worthless meat sacks?" It claims that it joined your crew to find out.</text>
	<text>The Mantis says it respects you because of your personal actions and the Federation for its former victories in battle, but it also thinks both the human species and the galactic alliance it is connected to will eventually be destroyed by stronger forces. You wonder if it refers to the swarms or the Rebels.</text>
	<text>The Mantis wonders if it will ever rejoin its former clan.</text>
	<text>The Mantis says since it joined the Federation, its former clan sees it as a traitor and has exiled it. The creature claims it does not care, but does it really?</text>
	<text>The Mantis explains that slavery, and the dependency on "weak aliens", was one of the reasons for it to leave the swarms. Now it has doubts if the Federation was the stronger alliance to choose. What should you make of this?</text>
	<text>The Mantis says it is reading about the Federation-Mantis war in its free time. It compliments you on the Federation's tactical decisions, but criticizes its "lack of viciousness and thirst for essential body fluids."</text>
	<text>Your Mantis asks if you want to see its collection of human thumbs, then it bursts into badly autotranslated laughter. You remain silent, so the creature explains that it still does not understand how jokes work. "What is this social practice good for anyway? Arg, Aliens..."</text>
	<text>The Mantis is confident its species will eventually wipe out the Federation and Rebels altogether and rule supreme over the galaxy. "Don't worry Captain, it's unlikely we will live to see it. And I, as a Federation collaborator, will have no place in this future anyway."</text>
	<text>The Mantis stresses the many advantages of boarding operations.</text>
	<text>The Mantis is contemplating the war effort of the swarms. Even if the Rebellion could be defeated, will there be more war? The creature hopes so.</text>

	<text>Your Rockman is just absently mumbling something and moves on through the hallway. There was a time when a Captain's authority was respected more...</text>
	<text>Your Rockman is fed up with the situation on the homeworlds. "I doubt my breathren will ever embrace change."</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman reveals that one of the reasons for it to leave the home worlds is that it wasn't allowed to marry its great love. The couple was from different casts.</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman reveals that several members of its family died by the hand of the Rock Grand Inquisition.</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman says it is content to serve under your command, as you do not judge it by its low cast.</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman explains that it would never have been able to get a position as good as this one in its home system because of its caste and low upbringing.</text>
	<text>The Rockman has become quite bitter. "If you have to fight my kind, don't you worry too much. The Rock empires are ruled only by greed and money. Most of my people have become decadent extremists, they deserve to suffer so that they learn to change." You don't know what to make of this.</text>
	<text>The Rockman asks which Federation Academy you attended. It proudly informs you that it has, for many standard years, studied ballistics and ship-to-ship combat at a Rock court school.</text>
	<text>The Rockman explains that religious sins weigh heavy on its people's consciences. Most Rockman work hard to live a good life. The only problem is that there are religious rules that allow you to clean yourself of sin by donating to the Rock religious cast. This lead to a moral decay of the rich Rock military elite.</text>

	<text>The Rockman is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters. "Is this urgent? I am studying tactical planning, Captain."</text>
	<text>The Rockman is analyzing the damage to the ship. "The vessel isn't taking it too well, Captain".</text>
	<text>The Rockman is busy sealing a micro breach.</text>
	<text>The Rockman is thrilled by all the opportunities for combat in this sector. You ask it to remain disciplined. "Of course, Captain!"</text>
	<text>The Rockman is remaining calm in face of all the dangers this sector holds. You are glad that some of your crewman possesses such self discipline.</text>
	<text>The Rockman has been injured in one of the recent battles. You wonder how exactly the creature's body heals. The medical equipment aboard the ship has some special devices to deal with Rockman.</text>
	<text>The Rockman wisely advises you that a good offense often is the best defense.</text>
	<text>The Rockman thinks the last battle was honorably fought.</text>
	<text>The Rockman thinks the last battle was not so memorable.</text>
	<text>The Rockman complains that you could have done better in some of the recent battles. "You shall contemplate on your tactics, Federation Captain."</text>
	<text>Your Rockman says you are handling the situation well. They also claim that all the violence in this sector is nothing compared to what is going on in the Rock Homeworlds, where millions of religious dissidents have been dissolved alive in the system's acid clouds by the Rock Grand Inquisition.</text>
	<text>Your Rockman is worried by all the hostility in this sector. "Battle is honorable, but endless battle brings only destruction." The conversation drifts off and the Rock crew member shares some memories of the Rock Grand Inquisition on the home worlds. A dark and ongoing chapter in its species history.</text>
	<text>Your Rockman wonders if the ship will make it through this dangerous sector. "I'm not questioning your combat efficiency, but there is only so many hits a vessel can take. And we face many enemies..."</text>
	<text>Your Rockman never thought it would face such great opponents as in this sector. "I fought the Rock Inquisition as a pirate for some years. Did you know that Captain?" The crew member claims the Inquisition would, had he ever been caught, thrown him alive into a sun. In order to "purify" the being.</text>
	<text>All the combat in this sector reminds your Rockman of the the great battles its kind has fought.</text>

	<text>The Zoltan is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, listening to music.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan explains that its kind has done away with distinctive genders a long time ago. "We removed certain features of our physical body via genetic engineering. Now we are all male and female at the same time, we are all one and everything."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan politely inquires if you slept all right. "Did you dream something Captain? Dreams can tell us a lot about the energies that surround us." It asks you to tell it your dreams the next time you have any.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan inquires when you had a good rest for the last time. "Your task is not easy, a lot of responsibility, but you will make it through this, I'm certain." You're not sure if the being's facial expression says the same.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks how you feel. "I'm always happy to talk to you, Captain."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan pleads to install a stungun on the ship and incapacitate any hostile you might encounter instead of killing them. "This bloodshed does not have to continue, Captain. There is always a more peacefull way!"</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what you think about love.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what happiness means for you.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what worries you the most.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks if you are all right with the rest of the crew.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan suggests you should not be too harsh with the crew. "If anything happens to them, it might be too late to apologize."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan is amazed by the discipline of your crew. "These people would do almost anything if you command them to. They just follow your orders, whatever happens to them, it will be your responsibility."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan contemplates, that if you fail in battle, it will most likely be your own fault. "There is much to learn in the art of war. Do you think you know enough? Do you think you know everything? Maybe there is still more to learn... I just wish people would study the art of peace instead."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan looks tired. "Captain... I don't know if I should tell you but I had a horrifiying vision last night. I saw you die. I saw us all die. Burned and shattered and sucked into space." You tell the crewmen to focus on the task at hand and try not to think about what you just heard.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan looks tired. "Ah Captain... I saw the most curious thing in my sleep. A great arrival. The Lanius fleet, it has returned... Well maybe it was just a dream... but I have heard that the scavenger species has been sighted at the edge of known space lately..."</text>
	<text>The energetic being smiles at you. "Are you alright Captain? I hope our situation does not trouble you too much."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan marvels at the fact that other species have such short lifespans. It has read a lot on that topic.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan appreciates your interest, "You take good care of your crew, Captain."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan appreciates that you follow Federation protocol "most of the time".</text>
	<text>The Zoltan suggests that you always question your actions. "Are you doing the right thing, Captain?"</text>
	<text>The Zoltan, in this quiet moment, reveals to you that it is sometimes scared by the power it inherently posses.</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member tells you it is considered somewhat of a rogue among its kind, since it broke three Zoltan guidelines during its life.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan is happy you wish to talk. It says it has formulated several crew protocols for you to enforce on the ship, and knows that you will make sure that "law will prevail".</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member seems a little sad during your talk. It misses the radiant glow of the space station it was living on a few years ago and invites you for a visit after you complete your mission.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan tells you it is a little upset with the "lack of discipline regarding hygiene protocols" exhibited by some members of the crew. You ensure the Zoltan you will enforce the protocols, and it gratefully thanks you.</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member asks you to consider showing mercy to enemy crews which ask to surrender - "True progress can only come through compassion and understanding". You promise to remember those words.</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member suggests you recruit more Engi, since they are "efficient and follow strict protocols". It also says it will be happy to study how Engi interact with other species.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan still hopes that some way to reconciliation can be found in the current conflict.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan pledges that you accept every enemy surrender. The rules of space combat don't demand this, but killing people that try to surrender is still generally perceived as uncivilized.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what you will do in the case your mission actually succeeds and the Rebels are defeated. "Truly grand is he who knows to show mercy to his enemy. And that even rhymes, Captain. Think about it!"</text>
	<text>The Zoltan claims that it was able to power an entire shuttle craft when it was a few hundred years younger. Impressive.</text>

	<text>The Slug seems almost unaffected by all the substances it offers. "You want another one, Captain?"</text>
	<text>After a few more drinks you and the Slug got the whole current conflict figured out: The actual problem is the Society!</text>
	<text>The stuff the Slug offers is quite potent. Is it even legal to have this aboard the ship?</text>
	<text>The Slug offers you a bowl of hot liquids. "Thatss from my home collony. Inhale the fumesss. Itss really good!" It indeed is! A few deep breaths later your crewmen gets you to mockingly desert the Federation and swear alliance to the Slug Empire.</text>
	<text>While mixing drinks, the Slug tells you about the part of its live when it was still exporting luxury goods to its homeworld. "Good timess. And lotsss of profit!"</text>
	<text>While downing your drinks, you ask the Slug where all the strange sculptures in it's quarters come from. "Oh thesse? I made them myself. I studied eccentric art in the home nebula for sssome time. They are alsso my pension fund. The Zoltan pay excellent pricess for these, you know?"</text>
	<text>This was good, but you start to get a strange feeling...</text>
	<text>The Slug opens an unlabeled bottle for you and then starts to improvise on some strange Alien instrument. You stretch out on a comfortable couch and look out of the view port. Your personal terminal beeps: "Eh Sir, do you want to review that damage report you ordered?" You klick the terminal off. This can wait.</text>
	<text>This nebula whine that the Slug gave you is supposed to have a "unique relaxing effect", but you actually don't feel anything.</text>
	<text>How was that last drink called again? You already don't remember anymore...</text>
	<text>Half drunk, the Slug openly admits that It often considered abandoning the Federation altogether. "Thiss whole conflict isss sstupid. But ass long asss it lasstss I could still make a fortune by trading nebula gass to the Rebels. Would be much lesss rissky than actively taking ssides."</text>
	<text>While downing your galaxy import, the Slug tells you about its youth. Its parents came to wealth by trading cheap Engi machinery to the isolated Rock sectors, but disowned your crewmen due to some corruption scandal.</text>
	<text>The Slug pours you some gelish, purple liquor. "Cheerss! To our misssion! I hope thiss isss all worth it... You know, I wass making a fortune exporting Zoltan Shield Componentss to sscared civiliansss when the Rebellion sstarted. But now I'm not ssso ssure that thiss whole war iss really profitable for everyone."</text>

	<text>The Slug advises you to put aside your morals and concentrate on a little more on this great chance to "dissscover ssssome valueblessss". You wonder what it means by "discover"...</text>
	<text>Your Slug looks a little sad. When you ask it why, it tells you it misses the "sssstarlessss ssspaccce" of the nebula in its home sector.</text>
	<text>Your Slug seems unfocused and absent minded. It suddenly snaps back to reality and explains it tried to telepathically scout the current sector, but is still not skilled enough for such a feat.</text>
	<text>The Slug tells you it feels quite sorry for you, since you are so poor and without hope of reaching "the firssst sssstage of economic sssstability".</text>
	<text>The Slug relates a tale of how it once served on a ship which managed to disable the life support system of a Rock cruiser and suffocate all the Rockman aboard. You can't help but shudder at the thought.</text>
	<text>Your Slug crew member is puzzled by the Rebels. It can't understand why humans would fight for anything other then gaining more wealth.</text>
	<text>The Slug looks at your legs with amusement. It asks you how you can possibly keep upright and stable. "Tailssss are better!" it says in conclusion.</text>
	<text>The Slug is sorry about the all the slime it leaves behind on the ship. It chuckles.</text>
	<text>The Slug says that it can fix a good deal for you if you ever get to a Slug blackmarket.</text>
	<text>The Slug wonders why you never consider surrendering when combat turns nasty. "Just sswallow your pride and give away ssome sscrap and fuel. Enemies do thiss all the time, iss thiss so difficult for you to do?"</text>
	<text>The Slug thinks you look stressed. It offers you a massage. You politely decline.</text>
	<text>The Slug thinks you look stressed. It offers to cook up some real nice Slug specialty, to heighten your spirits. You politely decline the offer.</text>
	<text>The Slug thinks you look stressed. "Is it about money, Captain? I can help you out... No risk involved." You seriously doubt that.</text>
	<text>The Slug explains that Slug Gel is actually made of nanobots. "Ssome people believe we are ssome kind of mystical beingss. They buy our sslime and think it can fix hull breachess. It's like I would buy the air you exhale and hope it would cure my enzyme-gland problemss. Hehe, sstupid alienss."</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "We could sell small arms to some pirate warloardss we come accross. What do you think?"</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "We could ssell luxury goods to this arrogant living Glow-stickss."</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "Transport ssome ore to my breathren, we don't have many asteroids in our nebula."</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "I wass told that gass and ore are alwayss in demand in indussstrial sssectorss."</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "Disseassse is spreading in the current crissis, or so I was told. If we can get some pharmaceuticalss we could sssell them in quarantined sectorss, for triple the price! We have to help thosse poor people."</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "Most of my ssstupid colleaguess would sssell their father for ssome luxury trash from the core-worlds. Idiotss..."</text>
	<text>The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "Think of it, you have a cruisser and a lot of cargo ssspace. If you play your cardss right we could all be rich. Maybe rich enough to buy oursselfss out of thisss horrible misssion..."</text>
	<text>The Slug understands that greed is not the best foundation for a galactic civilization. "You ssee Captain, in the end, it doess not matter much. What people do and believe in doess not really affect how thingss turn out for them. It'ss mosstly about caussality and... luck. I believe in luck, Captain."</text>

	<text>The AI Avatar is not responding. Blinking lights on its holo generation-unit signal that all of its processing power is currently used. You leave it alone, as you have to assume that it is calculating something ship related.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that it can think almost a thousand times faster than you. Having a conversation with a sentient alien must be quite boring for it.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously talks to several other crew members over the intercom, analyses the ship's hull integrity, simulates possible combat encounters at the next beacon, downloads cute kitty videos from galaxy net and observes a nearby supernova.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously designs a virtual art piece, studies several forms of martial arts, monitors the crew's vital signs, analyses the secret data you carry, and makes statistic predictions on the outcome of the entire conflict.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously is busy developing ship weapons based on materials that do not yet exist, tracks all the paths of the debris in a nearby asteroid field, and simulates cooking every dish known to Slug history (apparently a lot).</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously is analyzing sensor data, tracking all ships in scanner range, developing a cure for a minor outbreak of the flu aboard and... You interrupt and ask if it can also be less arrogant about its processing capabilities at the same time.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that it thinks extremely fast. It even has special sub-routines for talking with organic beings, mainly there to keep it from becoming bored to death by the slow conversations.</text>
	<text>Your AI crew member tells you it is happy to serve aboard your ship. It says it is better to be a sentient slave then not to be sentient at all. You wonder if this is supposed to be funny, honest or hidden criticism.</text>
	<text>The AI tells you it feels lonely sometimes, and would be happy if you could employ more AIs to serve on the ship.</text>
	<text>The AI asks you what you are going to do after the war. It says it would prefer to continue serving you instead of being erased.</text>
	<text>The AI wants to be a painter one day.</text>
	<text>The AI considers becoming a doctor after this all is over. "I want to save lives for a change, Captain. Does all this destruction we cause not depress you?"</text>
	<text>Upon inquiring, the AI explains how its generation unit works. Dynamic photon emitters and gravitational field generators create its physical body. Its "mind" is housed within an AI core that mimics an organic brain with extremely dense biological-circuits.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar explains that it is designed as a thinker, not a fighter. Physical trauma and weapon impacts will damage its bio-curcuits. The avatar will require medical attention and bio-stabilizers in case of injury, just like other crew.</text>
	<text>The AI Avatar is calculating the likelihood of sustaining terminal damage in a "no-escape" scenario. "Hits to my station from certain advanced ship to ship weapons might instantly destroy my physical form. Please protect me, ok?" The entity smiles.</text>
	<text>Your AI seems puzzled by the fact that you must breathe. It asks you if you are not afraid of forgetting to breathe when you are occupied. You are assuming it is trying to make a joke.</text>
	<text>The AI requests you explain to it the concept of sleep. It asks you if you are not afraid of having your memory erased when you lose consciousness</text>
	<text>Your AI wonders if you can be considered its parent. It says it expects you to take good care of it.</text>
	<text>Your AI crew member asks you to describe the mating rituals associated with you species. It can't understand why you would chose such a cumbersome way to reproduce.</text>
	<text>The AI tells you it does not want to accidentally be erased, and asks you to make sure you keep at least four copies of its data matrix stored on the ship computers.</text>
	<text>The AI says you should consider creating an AI avatar template based on your own persona. This way, other ship crews will be able to benefit from your skills. You tell the AI you will think about this.</text>
	<text>Your AI asks if you will allow it to join an Engi hive after your mission is done. It thinks Engies are probably the only species which can truly understand AIs.</text>

	<text>You want to talk to the Lanius, but realize that you micro rebreather is completely depleted from the last conversation. Better not risk asphyxia just for a little chat. This will have to wait.</text>
	<text>You Lanius explains that its kind has developed special oxygen suits. It prevent the Lanius body from absorbing too much O2 in closed environments. The suits are mostly used by diplomats and traders. Unfortunately, your crewmen did not bring one aboard.</text>
	<text>The Lanius confesses that it finds your eating habits extremely strange. "For me... theses substances are dirt."</text>
	<text>The Lanius found out that its quite real "heart of steel" is a strong metaphor in your language. The anaerobic being finds this quite fascinating. "Even as a metaphor... this might be the truth for the great number... of my metallic... friends."</text>
	<text>You try to have a proper conversion with the Lanius but soon start to feel dizzy... what is happening? You cant breath... Shortly before passing out, you wave the Lanius away from you and head for the bulkhead. Their oxygen absorbing metabolism should not be underestimated. The crewmen later sends a crudely translate apology.</text>
	<text>You picked up a few words of Lanic during your travel and use your little language skills to ask the crewmen how it feels today. It reacts with a gesture that, according to your pan-alien transcultural training, might indicate insult. Did you say something wrong?</text>
	<text>The Lanius confesses that it finds your kind most unusual. "You are similar too... fictional characters from our... great text assortments. Almost like... not from this Galaxy? Scientific impossibilities!"</text>

	<text>The Lanius mourns that its species demanding metabolism has caused the galaxy so much suffering. "We are no... villains Captain. We just... need to feed us."</text>
	<text>The Lanius asks how much data you have about this sector. "Are there... metallic opportunities?"</text>
	<text>You find the Lanius in the mess hall. While you eat your ration, a sluggish conversation ensues. After you finish eating, the Lanius points both its bladed arms at your synth-steel plate. "You... still eat him?" You slowly shake your head. The Lanius grabs the plate and absorbs it into its hand. "The best ration... on this plain, Captain. You should... train in it?"</text>

	<text>The Crystal is surprised with the efficiency of the life support system on your ship. It tells you the lowered metabolism of Crystals made them less dependent on such systems on their ships.</text>

	<text>The Crystal crew member is apprehensive about Slugs. "They are so greedy and we know nothing of your galaxy." It assumes the Slugs will try to take advantage of its kind.</text>
	<text>The Crystal looks a little light headed when you speak. It tells you it is not used to the high oxygen pressure on your ship. You assume the Crystal will get used to it, but order a medical checkup nevertheless.</text>
	<text>The Crystal assumes that everything coming from outside its hidden home-world would have great value there. "My kind would surely buy all these silly and curious objects that the aliens trade at good prices."</text>
	<text>Upon inquiring, the crewmen explains that the retaliation crystals of its factions ships are actually using resonance energy from kinetic impacts to target and propel themselves. You consider that it just made this up.</text>

	<text>The bulk of the fleet has already moved passed this location. You slowly navigate the ship below the beacon and power down all non-essential systems. A seemingly endless caravan of Rebel supply ships moves past, huge lifter crafts accompanied by smaller pushers, but no one notices you. When the FTL is charged, you prepare for a low profile fast jump.</text>
	<text>The beacon is flagged as "liberated", but suprisingly there are no ships around. The fleet must have moved on already. You can't believe your luck.</text>
	<text>You spot a few cruisers in the distance, but they move away quickly and do not seem to notice you. It is clear that you won't be always this lucky. You have to get out of Rebel territory immediately.</text>
	<text>This beacon is under Rebel control, but the fleet has not reinforced this position and did not even leave a guard unit. A mistake you can now exploit.</text>
	<text>The Rebels have already move past the beacon and suddenly you find yourself behind enemy lines. You try to lay low and it is only luck that there are so few ships in the the vicinity. A few auto scouts zip past, but do not actively scan and just seem to be dedicated to reach the front line as fast as possible.</text>
	<text>To your surprise, no hostile ships are in the area. The front line must have moved already. Large caravans of civilian ships slowly follow in the wake of the fleet. Are these sympathizers? Traders? The rebels families? You have to lay low, so you can't find out.</text>
	<text>The Rebel guard units have been stationed far in the distance to deter any threads to a large civilian caravan. The people here naturally assume that you are a deserter or Rebel mercenary and engage in friendly chatting. They hope to found a new colony somewhere in conquered Rebel space, since their home planet has been devastated in the current conflict.</text>

	<text>A nearby scout turns to engage, but then makes way for a cruiser that jumps in right in front of your ship. You are hailed by a Rebel officer, "This is the RS 'Questionable Ethics'. We have you on our twelve. Raise your shields and fight to the death!"</text>
	<text>Disaster! You jumped in right under the nose of a well armed Rebel cruiser. They send a hail, "This is the RS 'BBQ Chips', our weapons are primed. Get ready to be targeted, Fed scum!"</text>
	<text>One of the cruisers is already in firing range! They hail, "This is the RS 'Dirty Unicorn'. Many of our fleet assets are converging on this beacon. It's over for you!" You cut communication and get the engines ready.</text>

	<text>The Rebels made sure that this key position is well protected, they stationed a cruiser squadron near the long-range relay. You are hailed by a Rebel officer, "This is the RS 'New Recruit'. I was ordered to deal with you personally. Sorry that is had come to this. I was a Federation Officer once you know... We will open fire now, you will not withstand us for long."</text>
	<text>A Rebel cruiser guards the system exit. You receive a high priority message, "This is the Rebel Forward Cruiser RS 'Isn't it Ironic?'. Our tubes are loaded and reinforcements are on the way. Any last words?" They don't wait for your answer and cut communication.</text>
	<text>A fully armed Rebel cruiser already waits for you. They must have known that you would exit the system here. A message comes in, "This is the Rebel primary asset RS 'Pretty Good Shot'. You will not get away this time. Pound them boys!"</text>
	<text>You aren't surprised that the Rebel fleet has immediately stationed a cruiser squadron here. It is only logical to guard the system exit as best as possible. At least they contact you before they open fire, "This is the Rebel Guard asset RS 'Beacon Eater'. You will have to get past us if you want to leave this system. Be assured, we will do anything to prevent you from leaving!"</text>
	<text>The Rebel fleet has already moved in cruisers here. You are hailed by the closest unit, "This is the Rebel Guard asset RS 'Sun Hugger'. Just wanted to let you know who you are dealing with. Now prepare to die."</text>
	<text>It's hardly surprising that a cruiser squadron has been moved in to guard this strategic position. You are hailed, "This is the Rebel Guard asset RS 'Overly Self Confident'. Just wanted to let you know who you are dealing with. Now prepare to die."</text>
	<text>A cruiser squadron guards this key position and their forward unit moves in to engage. "This is the Rebel Guard asset RS 'Pain Maximizer'. Let's be honest here, you know that you don't stand a chance against a ship with equal capabilities." They start their targeting sequence.</text>
	<text>A cruiser with large guns is stationed nearby. They get in an attack vector as soon as they spot you. "This is the Rebel primary unit RS 'Sugarcoated'. We will be in weapon range shortly... I'm sorry, but we've got our orders." They cut communication and load weapons.</text>
	<text>An interceptor squadron is patrolling the system, but they keep their distance. You realize why: a cruiser jumps in to deal with you. Instead of opening fire they send a message first, "This is the Rebel primary unit RS 'Gangsters Paradise'. My whole crew is made of hard-boiled elite officers with little humor.

	<text>As you arrive you are immediately hailed by a militia ship, "We know that you are carrying intel the Rebels want. It was a mistake to come here. We won't bend to Federation rule again!" They charge weapons.</text>
	<text>After jump completion a militia ship hails you, "Federation Sympathizer. You are under arrest. Hand over your ships control to us." You have to assume that these guys are cooperating with the Rebels... "Comply or prepare to be fired on." They lose patience fast and start to fire.</text>

	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The Diamond Sharks from the seas of Galtefor 5 are known for their seven sets of pure carbon teeth. You arrive to the water dominated planet and capture one of the creatures with the help of some local fisherman.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">This planet is home to a unique breed of Solthian Octopus. Its purple-colored head bears a striking resemblance to the banner of many pirate ships. Your crew in environmental suits stun the creature and brings it on board.</text>
	<text>This part of the galaxy is inhabited by a certain kind of Ionic Eels. A dangerous predator, the Ionic Eel has been known to prey on leviathans thrice its size! It stresses your shields, but you manage to capture the creature.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The Lermak Whale has been driven nearly extinct due to the Mantis's craving for its flesh. A small colony of the whales has survived at this planet. You hunt down one of the creatures.</text>
	<text>Sentient Radiant Fish from the depths of Smaral Beta's oceans are a little studied speies. These large fish are know to be extremely rare - they project multi-colored light bursts, with which to lure prey. You manage to convince one of the eloquent fish to meet the Curator.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The rare Suffa plants are cultivated by, and have some of the energized properties of, the Zoltans. An exiled hydroponics lab is using the unique climate of this planet to grow the bright red bushes. You manage to convince one of the Zoltan to give you a sample.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">After some digging, you unearth a Rockman ceremonial gong on a archaeological site at this planet. They are used in the more important religious ceremonies of the Rockman. Legend has it striking it three times can summon a hundred saints to aid a Rock basilisk in battle.</text>
	<text>Oldschool Slug hacking modules are a pretty obsolete combat tech, but have quite some collection value. The Curator was right assuming that you could easily find one at the huge space scrapyard that surrounds this beacon.</text>
	<text>A derelict Engi station, remote-jumped here from another sector, holds an original operational codex. These are the first behavioral programs used by the Engi. Since obsolete Codexes are almost always deleted when Engis develop new versions, it is quite a rare find.</text>
	<text>A Mantis egg sack from one of their abandoned hatcheries. Why the Curator would want to risk his life with a Mantis brood is beyond you.</text>
